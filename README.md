# monitor-server
Ping my development server and email me if it is running (in case I forgot to shut it down when not in use)

I use a Google Compute Engine instance for development purposes. If I shut it down when I'm not using it, I won't get 
charged for it during that time. This script pings the server every hour and emails me if it responds.
